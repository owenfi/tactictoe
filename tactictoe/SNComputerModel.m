/* Computer will be required to take turns.

 That will require:
 1. Knowing/receiving the game board state
 2. Returning a new position choice
 
 (2 could use a stateful strategy, but that seems overkill for basic tic tac toe)
 (1 might as well be a 2d array, since that most closely matches the game board metaphor)
